# A History of the Object in 100 Worlds

I was the Visualist-in-Residence at the [Institute of Cultural Inquiry, Los Angeles](http://culturalinquiry.org/) during the summer and fall of 2012. My project proposal was "Object-oriented Exhibit Design". Below is documentation of the installation and the text I used for a public presentation on October 13th. The project spun off into strange, yet fertile, territory. Object-oriented exhibition design was merely the dock from which I set off on a journey into paradox, poetry and noise.

## TL;DR: The display of an object is also its breaking.

## Object-oriented Exhibition Design
I started this project with the intention of developing an “object-oriented exhibition design”. By that I meant a means of designing museum exhibitions that did not place the human at the center of the universe, or, to put it differently, placed the objects at the center of the design process. “Wait!”, you cry. “Exhibition design already does this!.” I contend that what counts as “exhibition design” today either undermines or overmines the objects on display. The undermining of an object is the process by which we subordinate objects to some ideology, often in exhibition design, narrative. Or, undermining can be the scientific naturalist approach in breaking down an object into some ultimate bottom God-particle, to say that all objects are constituted of the same material. Overmining, on the other hand, is the denial of objects altogether, the argument of which maintains that what is essential are processes, flows, dynamism, universal movements, etc. that are larger than any specific object, where specific objects are merely manifestations of this universal movement.

### What is Exhibition Design?
My research into exhibition design is not exhaustive, nor is the field itself fully defined. What I have discovered, though, is that the guiding principle of ED is narrative. Numerous sources and authorities state that their beginning point is with a narrative concept and that objects and materials are then selected to best create an environment that illustrate a story.

When an exhibition is designed according to a narrative structure, the objects themselves are not allowed to be the multi-faceted wonders that they are. A strict delineation and delimitation occurs that specifies that this thing is this thing and no other. (As we will see later, this is not the case; once an object is removed from its context and situated in a new context, it becomes an entirely new object, though still the same on the interior, its intentional or sensual qualities are altered by the new relations and objects within which it becomes situated).

### OOO
#### Tool-analysis
Heidegger shows us in his tool-analysis that we relate to objects in one of two ways, either ready-to-hand or present-at-hand. The well-worn example is the carpenter and his hammer. When the carpenter is hammering, the hammer is ready-to-hand. He is not necessarily thinking about the hammer as a hammer, but is instead engaged in the process of hammering. But, if the hammer breaks, he turns his conscious awareness to the hammer and it becomes present-at-hand, no longer functioning as hammer. Now, an object doesn't necessarily need to break to become present-at-hand. We need only turn our conscious awareness towards it.

#### Tool-being
Along comes Graham Harman, who has this idea called tool-being. Harman extends Heidegger's tool-analysis to all objects, so that it is not only humans who encounter hammers either ready- or present-at-hand, but the hammer encounters the nail it strikes as ready- or present-at-hand. For Harman, all beings are tools. You, me, this computer I'm writing on, the screen or page on which you are reading this, etc. Furthermore, ready-to-hand is the tool in its being, whereas present-at-hand is the tool broken. Again, broken-tool doesn't necessarily imply that the tool actually breaks. What it means is that the tool is no longer doing its tool-thing in the world. It is removed from its context. It ceases to function in its tool-being.

#### Objects
So the display of an object is also its breaking. It may, in fact, be a double breaking. The first break occurring when the object is discovered and moved into the research laboratory. The second break occurring when the object is placed in a wall case, on a pedestal, or in a vitrine. Either, way, what is important for this discussion is that the object is now broken. It is no longer doing its tool-thing, though it is now doing an entirely new tool-thing. The object, that which  constitutes its mysterious inner core, does not change, but it's relations do as do its sensual qualities and accidents as the new context, or object, in which the first object finds itself redefine and reconstitute it as something different. Take for example the stone axe, once used for chopping and cutting, maybe some killing: in the museum, it performs none of the above. It is in a case, under lights, on display. It is effectively a new object, though still the same stone-axe. It is also effectively broken as it is no longer doing its stone-axe-thing. The stone-axe is not actually what narrative defines it as. It is something entirely different. It once, speculatively, may have been an implement of harvesting and warfare, but is now something entirely different. Narrative tends to deny this new role accorded to the object.

Furthermore, when you encounter the object on display and you pause to contemplate it as an object, you are removing yourself from your context, turning your conscious awareness to your thoughts about this thing, you are effectively breaking your mind. So, the display of an object is the encounter of two broken-tools.

#### Paradox.
Objects are paradoxical. They are defined by their relations and yet simultaneously withdrawn from all relations. No matter how we weigh, measure, photograph, x-ray, crush, pulverize, or disintegrate the stone-axe, we will never access its inner realm. It is forever hidden from us as are our own bodies. We will never truly know these meat bags that constitute our being. What we instead encounter are the sensual qualities.
